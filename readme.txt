WP-Definitions is an easy way to bring clarity to your blog. By adding double square brackets around any word like this [[word]] and the definition of that word will be included at the bottom of your post and the word will become a named anchor linking to the definition. Easy to install and easy to use. All definition that you use will be stored your database so the word will only have to be looked up once.
